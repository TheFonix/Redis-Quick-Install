# Redis-Quick

This has been created to work only on Ubuntu 16.04 it may work on older version but it has not been tried and tested! Use at your own risk!

Using this script will not setup any form of authentication just a bog standard Redis Server that can be started using `redis-server` from any location inside of your system.

This does not patch any writeback flags for storing! Sorry
